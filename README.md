# Homework assignment Open-Source Energy System Modelling
This is my repository concerning the homework assignment of the second lecture of Open-Source Energy System Modelling in 2024. 

This repository includes print-functions which output certain forms like a christmas tree and a diamond. The size of the forms can be adapted, and the diamond appearance can be changed as well.

The input parameters of these functions are checked with a CI-Workflow to guarantee, that the function works. In detail, the inputs are checked to be either a string or an integer.
